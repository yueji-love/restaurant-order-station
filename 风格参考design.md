# Qatalog — Style Reference
> ink on paper with two violet sparks

**Theme:** light

Qatalog operates as a near-monochrome productivity canvas: white background, dark slate ink, and a restrained two-violet accent system that appears as small functional punctuation rather than broad washes. Typography is compact and confident — Plus Jakarta Sans at weights 650-700 carries headlines with tight negative tracking, while Inter handles body and UI chrome at smaller sizes. Surfaces stay flat; depth comes from dark filled cards and 9px radii, never from drop shadows. The single vivid moment is a rainbow gradient that crowns the final dark CTA section, acting as the only chromatic release across an otherwise quiet, architectural layout.

## Colors

| Name | Value | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| Ink | `#292d34` | Primary text, dark surface fills, structural borders — cool near-black that reads as the dominant ink across the system |
| Pure White | `#ffffff` | Page canvas, card surfaces, text on dark fills |
| Slate | `#646464` | Secondary text, link borders, muted UI chrome — the mid-gray that carries nav, list borders, and body annotations |
| Charcoal | `#202020` | Dark filled button backgrounds, dark card surfaces, deep accent panels |
| Black | `#000000` | Icon fills, pure dark accents, maximum-contrast text on light surfaces |
| Ash | `#838383` | Muted helper text, badge borders, disabled-state borders |
| Fog | `#e8e8e8` | Hairline dividers, subtle surface separation |
| Mist | `#f0f0f0` | Subtle surface tint behind nav and ghost buttons |
| Iris | `#7b68ee` | Primary accent — link text, interactive borders, feature labels, eyebrow text; vivid violet used sparingly as a signal color |
| Aubergine | `#514b81` | Deep accent — section dividers, secondary violet border, paired with Iris for two-tone violet treatments |
| Prism | `linear-gradient(250deg, rgba(0,0,0,0) calc(50% - 36.1353px), #0091ff, #a43cb4, #f100e3, #0091ff, #a43cb4, rgba(0,0,0,0) calc(50% + 36.1353px))` | Anchor color of the signature rainbow gradient sweep (with cyan #0091ff and magenta #f100e3) |

## Typography

### Plus Jakarta Sans — Display and heading face — carries hero (60px), section headings (40-48px), and bold subheads (34px) at weights 650-700; the tight -0.035em to -0.047em tracking at 40-60px gives headlines a dense, engineered quality rather than airy SaaS default. Weight 400 is reserved for occasional body-large passages. Substitute: Inter, Manrope

## Components

### Primary Dark Button
**Role:** Filled CTA for conversion actions

Dark filled button with #202020 background, white text, 9px border-radius, 9px vertical and 20px horizontal padding. Inter weight 650, 16px, tracking -0.288px. Used for 'Get started' and signup actions. No drop shadow; depth comes from the dark fill against white canvas.

### Ghost / Text Link
**Role:** Secondary navigation and inline links

Borderless text link in Iris #7b68ee at Inter 16px weight 500-650, with a 9px-radius underline or pill affordance on hover. Frequently paired with an arrow glyph. Acts as the primary chromatic punctuation across the page.

### Outlined Action Border
**Role:** Accent border treatment for cards and feature highlights

1px border in Iris #7b68ee (or Aubergine #514b81 for secondary), 9px radius. Applied to feature cards and interactive surfaces that need accent emphasis without a filled background.

### Navigation Bar
**Role:** Top-level site navigation

White background, horizontal flex layout with logo left, nav items center, CTAs right. Nav text in Inter 14-16px weight 500, Slate #646464 for inactive, Ink #292d34 for active/hover. 9px-radius pill affordance for dropdown triggers. 12px vertical padding, 20px horizontal.

### Hero Card (Dark Product Preview)
**Role:** Dark surface that showcases the product UI

Large rounded panel with Ink #292d34 or Charcoal #202020 background, 18px border-radius, 32-48px internal padding. Contains product UI mockups (search bar, app grid) rendered in white/light tones against the dark surface. This is the page's signature component — a dark island floating on white.

### Feature Grid Card
**Role:** Two-column feature highlight blocks

Minimal card with no background or border by default. Iris #7b68ee title at Inter 16-18px weight 650, body copy in Slate #646464 at 14-16px. Cards sit in a 2-column grid with 30-48px row gap and no visible card chrome — the typography itself defines the unit.

### Eyebrow Label
**Role:** Section preamble text

Uppercase or sentence-case label in Sometype Mono or Inter weight 650, Iris #7b68ee or Slate #646464, 12-14px. Sits 16-24px above the heading it qualifies.

### Gradient CTA Panel
**Role:** Final conversion section with chromatic release

Dark Charcoal #202020 background panel with 18px radius, containing white headline text and a white 'Get started' button. The signature rainbow gradient (cyan #0091ff → magenta #a43cb4 → hot pink #f100e3) appears as a thin luminous band or edge highlight, providing the page's only multi-chromatic moment.

### Trust Logo Strip
**Role:** Social proof row of customer logos

Single horizontal row of grayscale partner logos (Dish, Deloitte, Pfizer, Adobe, American, NBCUniversal) on white background, separated by even 30-40px gaps. Logos rendered in Slate #646464, never in brand color.

### Search / Product Input
**Role:** In-product input affordance shown in mockups

Dark surface input with white placeholder text 'Search or Ask' in Inter 16-18px, full-width within the dark card, no visible border — defined by the dark surface beneath. Includes a + icon affordance and a dropdown of integration icons.

### Footer Link Column
**Role:** Multi-column site footer

White background, 5-column grid of link lists. Column headers in Ink #292d34 Inter 16px weight 650; links in Slate #646464 Inter 14px weight 400, 5-8px row gap. Logo sits above the first column.

### App Icon Tile
**Role:** Decorative product icon cluster in hero

Small rounded square tiles (9-12px radius) in white or light surface with colorful brand icons inside, arranged in a loose grid behind the dark search card. Rounded but not pill-shaped; flat color fills, no shadows.

### Star Rating Badge
**Role:** Social proof rating display

Row of small gold star icons followed by review count text in Inter 12-14px Slate #646464. Inline horizontal layout, no border or background.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use #292d34 Ink for all primary text and dark surface fills; never introduce a third near-black shade
- Reserve Iris #7b68ee exclusively for interactive text links, feature labels, and accent borders — never as a background fill or large headline color
- Set border-radius to 9px for all buttons, nav pills, and inline links; use 18px only for cards and large image containers
- Apply -0.035em to -0.047em letter-spacing on all Plus Jakarta Sans headlines at 40px and above; this tight tracking is signature
- Use Sometype Mono (or a mono substitute) for uppercase eyebrow labels at 12-14px, never for body copy
- Keep the page background pure white #ffffff; introduce surface tint only as #f0f0f0 Mist behind ghost controls or nav wells
- Let the dark Hero Card and Gradient CTA Panel be the only dark surfaces on a page; everything else stays light

### Don't
- Do not use Iris #7b68ee or Aubergine #514b81 as a filled button background — buttons are always Charcoal #202020 or ghost
- Do not add drop shadows to cards or buttons; the system is flat — depth comes from dark surface contrast only
- Do not use rounded corners above 30px anywhere; the 9px/18px pair is the system
- Do not introduce a third accent hue; the two-violet system (Iris + Aubergine) is the full chromatic vocabulary, plus the gradient panel
- Do not use serif, display, or decorative fonts; Plus Jakarta Sans and Inter carry the entire type system
- Do not use color for body copy other than Ink #292d34 (primary) and Slate #646464 (secondary); Ash #838383 is the floor for muted text
- Do not break the compact spacing rhythm with generous 60-80px element gaps; internal UI stays at 4-20px, with 80-120px reserved for inter-section breaks

## Elevation

The system is intentionally shadowless. Depth is communicated through surface color contrast (white canvas → dark filled cards) and 9px/18px corner radii, never through drop shadows. This keeps the interface flat, fast, and print-like.

## Surfaces

- **Canvas** (`#ffffff`) — Default page background, occupies the majority of screen real estate
- **Mist Well** (`#f0f0f0`) — Subtle tint behind ghost controls and nav wells
- **Dark Card** (`#202020`) — Hero product preview card and gradient CTA panel — the system's only dark surface tier
- **Ink Panel** (`#292d34`) — Secondary dark surface for product mockups and structural dark sections

## Imagery

Imagery is restrained and product-focused. The hero features a dark product preview card containing a search bar and a loose grid of colorful third-party app icons (Google Drive, Slack, Notion, etc.) as soft, slightly blurred decorative tiles behind the search affordance. A secondary image shows a dense field of glowing app icons on a near-black background, used as a decorative panel beside feature text. Photography is absent — all visual content is product UI mockups, icon clusters, and the one signature rainbow gradient. Icons are filled, brand-colored, and tightly cropped. Imagery occupies roughly 30% of the page, serving as demonstration rather than atmosphere.

## Layout

Max-width ~1200px centered container with generous outer margins. The page follows a vertical rhythm of alternating white bands and dark surface islands: a light hero with a dark product card on the right, a white two-column feature section with text-left/image-right, a full-width dark gradient CTA panel, then a dense multi-column footer. Section gaps are 80-120px, internal element gaps stay compact at 8-20px. Navigation is a single top bar, non-sticky, with logo left, links center, and two text CTAs right. Grids are conservative — 2-column feature rows, 5-column footer, single-row trust strip. The layout prioritizes whitespace and typographic hierarchy over visual density.

## Similar Brands

- **Linear** — Same compact monochrome foundation with a single accent hue used only for interactive signals; identical 8-10px radii and shadowless flat surfaces
- **Vercel** — Shared near-white canvas, tight typographic tracking, and dark-only product preview cards as the page's primary visual device
- **Notion** — Restrained two-color accent system (violet equivalents), generous whitespace, and typography-driven feature sections over heavy illustration
- **Stripe** — Architectural layout rhythm with alternating light/dark bands, plus Jakarta/Inter-adjacent sans-serif pairing, and minimal shadow reliance
